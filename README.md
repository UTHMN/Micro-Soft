# Micro:Soft
A Software for the __Micro:Bit__ V2,
Made by 1 guy who thinks he is a whole team.

## Current app count
- 7

## Q&A: How to flash?
Step 1. Download the hex file

Step 2. Plug in your micro:bit 

Step 3. Open files

Step 4. drag the hex file into your micro:bit

From that, your microbit will disconnect and reconnect automatically and run the code.
Do not unplug it whilst it restarts

Feel free to take any code no need for credits. I will upload a python file which I recommend you run on [here](makecode.microbit.org)
